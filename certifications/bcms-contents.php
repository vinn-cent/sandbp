                            Incidents can disrupt an organization at any time and applying <a href="https://sandbp.net/certifications/business-continuity-management-system">
                            ISO/IEC 22301 </a> will ensure that organizations can respond and continue its operations. Incidents take many forms ranging from large scale 
                            natural disasters and acts of terror to technology-related accidents and environmental incidents. However, most incidents are small but can 
                            have a significant impact and that makes business continuity management relevant at all times. This has led to a global awareness that 
                            organizations in the public and private sectors must know how to prepare for and respond to unexpected and disruptive incidents.

                            ISO 22301 enables you to respond effectively and promptly based on the procedures that apply before, during and after the event. Implementing

                            your organization will continue to operate without any major impacts and losses.
