                            Each S & BP certification has specific education and a set of experience

                            verify all eligibility requirements for the different certifications and their 
                            professional needs. Certification requirements are available on the website:

                            course or program of study will significantly enhance your chances of passing 
                            an S & BP certification examination. However, if candidates prefer a classroom training, 
                            they would be directed to our pool of accredited training partners-
